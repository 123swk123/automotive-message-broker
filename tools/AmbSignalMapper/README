AmbSignalMapper

ABSTRACT:

The AmbSignalMapper tool serves basic utilities for AMB signal mapping process.
It should take place in three steps:

1. Vector CANdb++ conversion into intermediate file (First phase)
2. Manual annotation of intermediate file (Second phase)
3. Processing of intermediate file and AMB plugin and WebIDL creation (Third phase)

The First phase is achieved by software utolity called dbc2json.
The second phase needs to be done by humans manually.
The third phase is again covered by software utolity called json2amb. 

PREREQUISITES:

    'Cwd',
    'Digest::SHA1'.

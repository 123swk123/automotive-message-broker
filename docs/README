Automotive Message Broker DBus API Documentation

AMB organizes the API into two general interfaces.  First a Manager interface which includes
tools for using the other interfaces.  Second is a series of interfaces that represent vehicle
data.  The later follows the schema of "org.automotive.DataType" and are contained in verious
DBus paths.

The data types are documented in the various *.txt files in this document folder.  The manager
interface is documented in the manager.txt document.

Basic Recommended Usage

It is recomended that the Manager interface be used to find the DBus Object that contains the
data type you need.  This is done through the findProperty() call.  It is expected that DBus 
Object Paths may change and so it is not appropriate to hard code DBus Object Paths.  The
DBus paths in the various documents are examples of paths and are not gauranteed.

Here is a pseudo-code example of how the api is to be used:

ObjectPath vehicleSpeed = manager.findProperty("VehicleSpeed");

/// interact with the 'VehicleSpeed' property on the vehicleSpeed object

log(vehicleSpeed.VehicleSpeed);

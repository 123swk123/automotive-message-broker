Release notes for release 0.11

New features:

- DBus objects are divided by source and zone (ie /deadbeef23432aaacccbbb/0/VehicleSpeed)
- new "Zone" DBus property in each interface
- Get{PropertyName}() DBus method returns extended data about the property.
- new ZonesForProperty and FindPropertyForZone methods.
- new FindObject DBus method replaces findProperty
- OpenCV plugin has experimental CUDA support
- new "bluemonkey" plugin - a AMB -> javascript gateway
- new --warning and --error (-w and -e) command line arguments to ambd.
  These new arguments are useful for developers who want error and warning-
  free log output.

Changes:
- findProperty DBus method on org.automotive.Manager is deprecated.
- Several Properties were changed from Map types to basic types to take 
  advantage of zones:
-- Defrost, AirbagStatus, WindowStatus, WindowLockStatus, DistanceSensor,
-- OccupantStatus, SeatBeltStatus, and probably a few more.
- DBus API: Defrost was moved to the org.automotive.WindowStatus interface


Fixes:
- DBus API: property sigantures was sometimes being reported incorrectly.  
  These are now generated dynamically from the GVariant type.
- BasicPropertyTypes were being generated by the macro without name filled in.

Automotive Message Broker is a vehicle network abstraction system.  It brokers information from the vehicle
to applications.  It provides application with a rich API for accessing vehicle data.

Automotive Message Broker is built using CMake and requires libltdl (libtool), libjson-c, and boost packages.  


About the Git Tree:
master is expected to be unstable and may not even compile.  If you want something more stable, checkout one of the 
release branches (ie, 0.9.0, 0.10, etc)


To build:

cd automotive-message-broker
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

To install:

sudo make install

To run:

ambd

ambd can load different plugins.  The config file specifies what plugins to use.  The default config located in
/etc/ambd/config.  You can change this or use your own config to have ambd use your own plugins.  For example:

# copy the config to your own config
cp /etc/ambd/config myconfig

# edit myconfig and specify the path to your plugin:
# change the line: 
"sources" : [ { "path" : "../plugins/examplesourceplugin.so" } ],
# to:
"sources" : [ { "path" : "/path/to/mysourceplugin.so" } ],

Now you can run ambd with:

ambd -c /path/to/myconfig

also see ambd -h

Typically, AMB will be used with the DBus plugin.  The DBus plugin automatically makes internal AMB properties 
available over DBus.  See the DBus plugin documentation for more information (plugins/dbus/README).


Running with other plugins

To learn about running AMB with other plugins, please see the plugins/*/README.  


Running with the Qt mainloop:

Some source and sink plugins may want to use the Qt-based mainloop to take advantage of Qt features. To enable
the Qt mainloop, run cmake with -Duse_qtcore=On:

cmake .. -Dqtmainloop=On

You will also need to edit your config to enable the Qt-based mainloop:

{
	"mainloop" : "/usr/lib/automotive-message-broker/qtmainloopplugin.so",
	"sources" : [...],
	"sinks" : [...]
}

NOTE: by default the glib mainloop will be used.

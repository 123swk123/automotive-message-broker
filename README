Automotive Message Broker is a vehicle network abstraction system.  It brokers information from the vehicle
to applications.

Automotive Message Broker is built using CMake.  glib2 (with gio) and boost are the only dependencies
aside from the normal c/c++ toolchain.  Alternatively, Automotive Message Broker can be built to use
the Qt mainloop.  In this case QtCore is also a dependency.

To build:

cd automotive-message-broker
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

To install:

sudo make install

Automotive Message Broker is a vehicle network abstraction system.  It brokers information from the vehicle
to applications.

Automotive Message Broker is built using CMake.  

To build:

cd automotive-message-broker
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

To install:

sudo make install

To run:

ambd -c /path/to/config

ambd can load different plugins.  The config file specifies what plugins to use.  The default config loads the example plugins.  You can change this or use your own config to have ambd use your own plugins.  For example:

# copy the config to your own config
cp config myconfig

# edit myconfig and specify the path to your plugin:
# change the line: 
"sources" : [ "../plugins/examplesourceplugin.so" ],
# to:
"sources" : [ "/path/to/mysourceplugin.so" ],

Now you can run ambd with:

ambd -c /path/to/myconfig

also see ambd -h
